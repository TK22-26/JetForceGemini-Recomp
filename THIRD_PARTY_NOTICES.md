# Third-Party Dependency Status

The root MIT license covers original project contributions. Existing third-party
copyright and license notices retain their separate scope. It does not relicense
game content, generated ROM-derived output, or third-party code. Distribution of
a combined work must also satisfy every applicable dependency license, including
GPL requirements where GPL-covered components are used.

Third-party font files are vendored under `launcher/ui/fonts`, with their
SIL Open Font License notices and source/hash manifest. The launcher statically
links RmlUi and FreeType, fetched at the revisions in `launcher/ui/CMakeLists.txt`.
Their retained notices are indexed in [launcher notices](launcher/ui/THIRD-PARTY.txt)
and [notice provenance](launcher/ui/licenses/provenance.json).

Other external repositories are cloned locally under the ignored `tools/`
directory at commits recorded in `dependencies.lock.json`. These local build
and research dependencies are distinct from the components bundled in the
launcher release archive.

The tracked N64Recomp patch series necessarily contains limited context from
the MIT-licensed upstream source. Its required copyright and permission notice
is preserved byte-for-byte from the locked upstream revision in
`patches/n64recomp/LICENSE.upstream`. That notice applies to the upstream
material represented in the patch payload; it does not change the license of
project-authored material.

The RT64/Plume compatibility edits embedded in `CMakeLists.txt` retain
the exact pinned MIT notices in `patches/rt64/LICENSE.upstream` and
`patches/plume/LICENSE.upstream`.

The CIC-NUS-6105 challenge-response algorithm in
`src/runtime/cic_nus_6105.cpp` is conservatively attributed to X-Scale (2011).
The complete upstream copyright, redistribution conditions, disclaimer and
views paragraph are retained both in that source and in
`patches/cic/LICENSE.upstream`. The source was inspected at BizHawk commit
`bdddf4a58aa1a022afb11dc73294a81a5aa7bbd5`, path
`libmupen64plus/mupen64plus-core/src/memory/n64_cic_nus_6105.c`.
The project integration uses C++ types and packed PIF RAM. This notice applies
to the upstream algorithm; the project license does not override upstream rights.

## Components and attribution

| Component | Status |
|---|---|
| N64Recomp | MIT; local build tool; tracked patch context carries `patches/n64recomp/LICENSE.upstream` |
| LLVM/Clang | Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception; ignored local compiler toolchain |
| OpenSSH `ssh-keygen` | BSD-style/component-specific notices; OS-provided signature tool only |
| N64ModernRuntime | GPL-3.0-only; evaluated runtime reference, not the project's native bridge |
| RT64 | MIT; renderer |
| Plume | MIT; embedded compatibility patch context carries `patches/plume/LICENSE.upstream` |
| CIC-NUS-6105 algorithm | X-Scale (2011), permissive two-condition notice retained in source and `patches/cic/LICENSE.upstream` |
| Jet Force Gemini decompilation | No root license found; consulted facts-only for libultra identification (see attribution below) |

## Launcher dependencies

| Component | Retained notice |
|---|---|
| RmlUi 6.3 | [MIT](launcher/ui/licenses/RmlUi-MIT.txt) |
| RmlUi's robin_hood and itlib containers | [MIT notices](launcher/ui/licenses/RmlUi-Containers-MIT.txt) |
| RmlUi Debugger's Courier Prime Code fonts | [OFL notice](launcher/ui/licenses/RmlUi-Debugger-OFL.txt); retained for the aggregate target, including assets that the linker may omit |
| FreeType 2.14.1 | [FreeType License](launcher/ui/licenses/FreeType-FTL.txt) and [component notices](launcher/ui/licenses/FreeType-ThirdParty.txt), including BDF/PCF, The Open Group, hashing, zlib and HarfBuzz-derived source |
| Barlow | [SIL OFL 1.1](launcher/ui/fonts/Barlow-OFL.txt) |
| Chakra Petch | [SIL OFL 1.1](launcher/ui/fonts/ChakraPetch-OFL.txt) |

The launcher package includes these complete notices under `licenses/`, along
with font and notice provenance manifests. The package builder checks that
every license path referenced by `THIRD-PARTY.txt` exists in the archive inputs.
The launcher uses Win32/DX11; optional RmlUi backends and external FreeType
compression/shaping libraries are not enabled by this build configuration.
FreeType's internal zlib and HarfBuzz-derived source notices are still retained.

## Attribution: Jet Force Gemini decompilation (facts-only consultation)

The Jet Force Gemini decompilation project
(https://github.com/Ryan-Myers/Jet-Force-Gemini) was **consulted** during
Phase 6 for the sole purpose of identifying which addresses in our own
generated set correspond to libultra (N64 SDK) functions. Only factual
symbol data — libultra function names (public SDK API) mapped to ROM
addresses — was used, to guide independently authored HLE implementations.
**No decomp source, headers, or implementation was copied.** The libultra
HLE code in this project is original work authored to the public SDK
contract (see `src/boot/PROVENANCE.md`).

The decomp carries no observed license, so this is a maintainer-approved
research consultation of factual metadata, not a grant of copy rights; it
does not affect the underlying game copyright.

Pinned dependency records and build-tool inventory are in the
[dependency inventory](docs/legal/dependency-license-inventory.md).
