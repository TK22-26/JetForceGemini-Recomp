# PC controls status and follow-up

Updated 2026-10-09. The current priority is dual-stick controller support.

## Mouse and keyboard

Mouse and keyboard is suitable for an opt-in **single-player experimental
trial**. This is not full campaign or gameplay-feel acceptance.

Implemented behavior:

- Editable keyboard keys, five mouse buttons, and wheel directions; Normal and
  Expert presets matching the corresponding in-game control scheme.
- Raw mouse look and direct aiming, WASD movement, and forward/backward/sideways
  movement while in supported ground aim states.
- Independent camera and aim sensitivity, vertical scaling, and inversion.
- Mouse capture releases for focus loss, settings, pause, and scripted cameras;
  returning from settings waits for neutral controls.
- Keyboard and mouse-button rebinding is independent of the experimental
  switch. Turning experiments off retains saved bindings and disables the
  modern look/movement extensions. This corrects the previous gating bug.

The rebinding and tuning changes are implemented and have passed input and
RmlUi checks. The launcher and runtime builds completed; the final native replay
sweep and installation were not completed before work stopped. An already-running
older build does not acquire these code changes.

## Deferred KBM work

1. **Camera obstruction.** Steep angles near trees can hide part of the player.
   The game scenery solver and existing wall clearance remain in use. A lower
   body visibility probe was tried but did not resolve the captured obstruction,
   so that additional probe was removed rather than shipped as a completed fix.
2. **Pointer-driven game menus.** Guest menus accept keyboard navigation,
   confirmation, and back shortcuts with experimental controls enabled. Pointer
   position does not select guest menu items; full hover/click interaction is
   unfinished. The launcher/settings UI uses RmlUi and supports mouse input.
3. **Broader gameplay coverage.** Continue testing all weapons, character
   actions, swimming, jumping, transitions, rooms, and extended play sessions.
   Native replay cases are narrow checks, not campaign-wide acceptance. Special
   movement states currently keep the original game's movement logic.
4. **Multiplayer.** Modern camera and movement hooks currently require
   single-player gameplay. Split-screen support needs separate implementation
   and qualification; ordinary mapped controller inputs remain available.
5. **Additional controller backends.** Controller discovery currently uses
   XInput. Native support for other device APIs remains separate work.

These items are documented for later work. Do not resume the camera or KBM
feature investigation merely because this backlog exists.

## Current controller priority

- Reliable dual-stick camera/aim and simultaneous movement/strafe behavior.
- Normal/Expert presets, independent camera and aiming sensitivity, vertical
  scaling, deadzone, inversion, and selectable stick response.
- Preserve ordinary right-stick button mappings in menus, scripted scenes, and
  modes where the modern look path is inactive.
- Keep experimental controls visible for controllers, with only the relevant
  binding content shown for the selected device in the RmlUi mapping window.
- Rebuild and qualify the launcher/runtime pair before installing it for the
  normal launcher. Retain the supported-US and single-player qualification limits.

See [launcher controls](../development/launcher.md#keyboard-mouse-and-separate-stick-aim) and the
[reference/qualification notes](../upstream/perfect-dark-pc-reference.md).
Further execution must use the existing guarded investigation and its remaining
budget under [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md); this backlog grants no new allowance.
