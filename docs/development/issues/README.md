# Issue investigations and resolutions

Keep an issue record from the first reproducible report through its final verified
resolution. This is the persistent engineering history for bugs, regressions and
significant limitations. It complements [known issues](../../known-issues.md), the
[runtime fix log](../boot-gameplay-fix.md), and feature implementation notes; link
those sources rather than copying conflicting accounts.

## Recording policy

- Start or update a record while investigating, not only after success. Use the
  [template](template.md). Give the issue a stable descriptive filename and ID.
- Record symptoms and reproduction, affected version/profile/platform, severity,
  evidence provenance, observed facts, hypotheses, attempts and their results.
- Retain failed or inconclusive attempts when they explain a decision. Correct
  invalid evidence explicitly; do not silently promote a hypothesis to a cause.
- Record the actual final code/behavior change, why it fixes the demonstrated
  cause, regression checks, remaining gaps, and where it is available. A patch,
  successful build, or completed replay alone is not a verified resolution.
- Separate **reported**, **reproduced**, **candidate**, **verified in tests**,
  **awaiting live verification**, and **resolved/released**. State the specific
  scope of a pass. Record a commit/release only once one actually exists.
- Keep public records free of ROMs, generated game code, personal save data and
  identifying machine paths. Reference private artifact IDs and hashes as needed.
- Preserve useful findings from older feature/fix logs through links. Historical
  tests apply to their recorded build, not automatically to the current tree.

This practice applies to future work throughout the repository, including
launcher/UI, controls, runtime, rendering, audio, setup and tooling. Documentation
does not authorize reopening an exhausted investigation or reset guard budgets.

## Active and historical issue index

The historical rows below index existing evidence; they do not claim a new retest.
Detailed per-issue records are added as those issues receive further work.

For earlier runtime defects, retain the [existing fix log](../boot-gameplay-fix.md).
Other currently reported limitations remain in [known issues](../../known-issues.md).
