# MOD-001: Exit warp stops at the door instead of entering the next room

- Severity: navigation tool malfunction; blocks convenient travel for the boss reproduction.
- Status: native-contact correction released in v1.2.1; ten transitions verified; progression-independent explicit map warps requested for 1.3.
- Reported: 2026-10-18 UTC, during the official v1.2.0 Ichor capture.
- Affected profile: Windows official release v1.2.0, Live Map Warp to exits enabled.
- Related source: include/jfg/mod/navigation_mod.hpp (NavigationMod::warp_to_exit).

## Symptoms and reproduction

Double-click a live exit with the warp mod enabled. The player moves to the
physical door but does not enter the next room. The owner explicitly expects
the click to activate the exit and change rooms.

## Evidence and cause

The current implementation writes the exit actor's exact XYZ position to the
player, then returns. The supported game's exitControl (0x8002561C) requires
a strict negative signed plane distance for directional exits. exitInit
constructs its plane through the actor position: the current target is on the
boundary, not inside the activation half-space. Collision and update ordering
can also undo a bare position change before the exit is visited.

Source review establishes the center-on-boundary flaw; this is not yet a
verified fix for every exit. The game queues an eligible contact using the
player control's pending-exit pointer and contact timer, then controlPlayer
consumes it through the ordinary level transition path. The correction should
preserve condition checks, destination/spawn selection, area-clear prompts,
one-shot requests, and stale-room/scripted-scene rejection.

## Attempts and results

2026-10-18: inspected the released warp and pinned guest exit/control paths.
No build, autonomous game test, or change to the owner's active process was
made while the owner was navigating.

## Verification and remaining limits

The source candidate and focused eligibility/one-shot tests are written.
Their execution and a real room transition in a new build remain pending. The active official release is unchanged.

## Lessons

Object centers are not necessarily valid trigger points. A warp intended to
enter an exit must satisfy its contact semantics and use the game's own
transition handling, rather than assigning the displayed room identifier.


## Candidate implementation (not yet tested)

The hotfix source now queues the exact contact produced by exitControl, after
validating its instruction layout, active player/health, current exit, native
progression conditions, and absence of an existing transition. The original
controlPlayer remains responsible for the destination, spawn and region/clear
prompt. It does not overwrite global level IDs, unlock quest flags or grant
items. A diagnostic event records accepted requests for later capture review.

Focused tests cover contact state in both memory byte orders, disabled/stale/
replayed commands, existing pending transitions, pause/death, missing progression
and unknown guest layout. They have been written but not executed while the owner
plays. The active v1.2.0 capture still uses the old behavior.


## Owner regression clarification and history review

The owner confirms that exit warp previously entered the next room. Treat this
as a reported regression, not an intentional change in expected behavior.
The committed warp function has used exit-origin placement since ce6042e
and that function is unchanged in the released v1.2.0 source. This narrows
the search to exit geometry, collision/update ordering, and interaction with
other runtime changes; it does not invalidate the owner's earlier working use.
No specific introducing commit has been established.


## Native transition checks

The focused navigation tests pass. The copied-save route now crosses the actual exits from levels 43, 42, 44, 248, 146, 185, 153, 151 and 119 using the candidate contact request. The first fixture then chose an inactive overlapping exit at level 19, which was correctly refused. The revised fixture selects the open progression alternative. No quest state is overwritten. Physical launcher click and final visual acceptance remain pending.

The revised active-exit fixture also crosses level 19 into introduction 230 and then reaches the boss at 181. Both effective-input runs accept all ten native exit requests. Launcher click acceptance is still pending.


## Released scope and 1.3 progression bypass

The native-contact correction ships in v1.2.1 (main 40dad7f4). Its ten recorded
room transitions and separate Juno/Lupus fixture entries are retained evidence;
this is not manual coverage of every map exit.

The owner explicitly requests that 1.3 map exit warps enter the selected
destination even when normal progression requirements are unmet. This is a
change to the explicit warp mod only. Ordinary walking contacts must retain
their progression rules. Preserve valid current player/exit/session checks,
request freshness and nonce handling, and native destination/spawn semantics.
Do not grant inventory items or permanently unlock quest flags to implement it.
Locked/overlapping exits require focused and native transition verification.
This follow-up is open under GitHub #21; no 1.3 bypass is released yet.
