## Windows 10 setup

[Issue 4](https://github.com/TK22-26/JetForceGemini-Recomp/issues/4) reports four
setup failures with `v0.4.0-preview.1` and Windows PowerShell 5.1:

- Disabled firmware virtualization can lead to repeated restart instructions.
- Older WSL installations may reject the requested Ubuntu distribution.
- Missing Linux packages can cause the package check to stop setup.
- Long RT64 dependency paths can fail checkout; a retry can skip incomplete
  submodules left by the first attempt.

[Preview 0.4.0-preview.2](https://github.com/TK22-26/JetForceGemini-Recomp/releases/tag/v0.4.0-preview.2)
uses short build/dependency cache paths, enables Git long-path handling for
dependency downloads, and retries submodule initialization when a checkout
already exists. Its checked-command wrapper also preserves native stderr and
exit codes under PowerShell 5.1. These changes have automated coverage; the
reporter's complete Windows 10 installation sequence still needs a retest.

Firmware-virtualization detection, older WSL distribution handling, and
PowerShell prerequisite probes such as `Test-LinuxPackages` remain open.
Repeated restarts alone will not resolve every setup failure. The issue records
the reporter's workarounds; they are not a validated general automatic repair.
[Manual build setup](development/rom-bootstrap.md) is available for users
comfortable installing and checking prerequisites.

## Release and source versions

Each released launcher builds its pinned source revision. `main` can contain
newer gameplay fixes, so include your launcher version and game/source build
when reporting. See [getting started](getting-started.md) for both paths and
[recent fixes](development/boot-gameplay-fix.md) for their validation scope.

## Controller coverage

The preview supports keyboard input and Xbox/XInput controllers. Other
controller types need an XInput-compatible driver or adapter. Native
DirectInput/HID mapping and rumble configuration are not implemented.

## Gameplay coverage

Maintainer-reported progress is tracked in the [README](../README.md#campaign-playtest-progress).
Full campaign completion and original-console accuracy remain unverified. Report a specific
failure with the location and reproduction steps using the
[playtesting guide](playtesting.md).

## Player shadow darkness

The native renderer retained a raw player silhouette because its offscreen
intensity buffer was not returned to game memory. The game's CPU blur and
opacity reduction therefore read an empty buffer. Preview 0.4.0-preview.3 builds
return these masks before task completion and preserve subsequent CPU edits.
A copied-save Juno test in the tutorial confirmed the processed opacity range
against Angrylion and exited cleanly. See [the renderer fix and validation
scope](development/boot-gameplay-fix.md#player-shadow-cpu-postprocessing).
Older builds need rebuilding; full-campaign shadow accuracy remains unverified.

## Particle textures

Preview.4 fixes stale renderer memory that produced opaque
particle rectangles. The recorded Vela water splash has before/after replay
validation. The maintainer also confirms that all previously reported broken
particle effects now render correctly, including dust, pickup sparkles, ship
exhaust and Tawfret rain. Juno's water splash has not been tested.
See [the renderer evidence](development/boot-gameplay-fix.md#cpu-texture-refresh-after-framebuffer-reuse).

## Support reports

Preview 0.4.0-preview.2 supports session selection, filtered system/build details,
crash stacks and an on-demand freeze snapshot. Rebuild an older game to gain the
native capture features. Capture remains best effort: forced termination, early
startup failures, corrupted stacks or access restrictions can leave partial logs.
These are text stack snapshots, not full-memory dumps. See [playtesting](playtesting.md)
for the file inventory and attachment instructions. Nothing uploads automatically.

## Experimental navigation mod

Preview 0.4.0-preview.3 includes an opt-in Navigation mod with a live height map,
item/NPC markers, a character inventory tracker, and shared walking/jump routing.
NPC reward dialogue, item-room returns and door requirements have focused tests.
The unified stair/NPC route has recorded-geometry and simulated-command coverage;
a full native run of that sequence and autonomous campaign completion remain
unverified. Lupus hover, moving platforms, shooting/explosive gates and unsupported
scripted traversal still need manual play. Normal gameplay leaves the mod off.
See [navigation validation and limits](development/navigation-mod.md).
