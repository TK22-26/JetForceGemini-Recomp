// Deterministic stackful thread executor (Phase 6 native boot).
//
// Recompiled game threads are imperative C that calls libultra (e.g.
// osRecvMesg) mid-function and expects to block there until woken. To run
// that real code we need genuine stacks. This executor gives each guest
// thread a real OS thread but enforces that **exactly one participant runs at
// a time**, handing a single "baton" back and forth. The scheduler decides
// who runs next, so the interleaving is fully determined by scheduler choices,
// not by host thread timing — deterministic, while preserving real stacks.
//
// Why real threads and not fibers: real stacks are natively understood by
// AddressSanitizer (no fiber switch annotations), and the baton guarantees no
// concurrent access, so there are no data races to reason about.
//
// This is the execution substrate; binding it to osCreateThread/osStartThread
// and the message-queue HLE is a later brick.
